                    environment that is safe, clean, healthy and child-oriented. An environment where classrooms are arranged in a manner
                    that it offers challenging play and learning choices at a range of developmental levels. Activity areas are designed
                    where children are allowed to explore, experience, and most importantly, succeed.
