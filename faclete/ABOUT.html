<h4>Art & Craft</h4>
<p>And it's not just about crafts. We provide space, equipment and – crucially – the technical help to make full use of
this for students across Painting, Drawing and Printmaking, Photography, Film, Graphic Design, Games, Illustration,
Fashion, and more. And we are firm believers in an open door policy. Students across all areas of the school can use
equipment across campus. We encourage fashion designers to work with photographers; film-makers can collaborate with
costume; and lots, lots more.
